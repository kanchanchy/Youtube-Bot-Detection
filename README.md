# Youtube Bot Detection
There are a lot of videos on Youtube that are bot inflated. A bot inflated video is a video that has fake views generated by software. Bot inflated videos also increase the likes and comments generating fake likes and comments by the use of software. The purpose of this repository is to detect this type of Youtube videos. It makes use of various information such as ratio of likes and views, ratio of likes and unlikes, ratio of views and comments and so on. It also checks whether a video has same comment numerous times and whether that comment is related to the video.

The repository shows how to crawl information about videos and comments. Then, it makes use of the crawled information to detect whether a video is bot inflated or not through machine learning algorithms. The use of both K-means clustering and one class SVM has been shown in this repository.
